          <h1>Python Microservices for the real world </h1>
          <p>When we started to create a microservice with no previous knowledge, we started looking for tutorials, guides, best practices, but we found
            nothing to create professional projects. Most articles say: </p>
          <ul>
                    <li>"Install flask"</li>
                    <li>"Create routes"</li>
                    <li>(Sometimes) "Create a swagger specs"</li>
                    <li>"TA-DA! you have a microservice"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>But... what happens when we want our configuration out of the code, such as a Kubernetes configmap? what happens with transactionality?
            If we have many microservices, what happens with traces?.</p>

          <p>There are many problems around Python and microservices and we couldn't find anyone to give us a solution.</p>

          <p>We start creating these projects to try to solve all the problems we have found in our professional lives about
          microservices architecture.</p>

          <p>Nowadays, is not perfect and we have a looong roadmap, but we hope this library could help other felas and friends ;)</p>
