This command uses [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to download and install this [template](https://github.com/python-microservices/microservices-template)

!!! warning
    First, you must run `pip install cookiecutter==1.7.0`

## Create a key encrypt/decrypt file

Command: 
```bash
pyms create-key
```

Create a key file to encrypt strings in your configuration file. This key is created with [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).
You can run the next command in the terminal. See [Encrypt/Decrypt Configuration](encrypt_decryt_configuration.md)
for more information

## Encrypt a string

Command: 
```bash
pyms encrypt [string] 
```

Encrypt a string to use in your [configfile](configuration.md)

```

```bash
optional arguments:

This command uses [prance](https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/prance) to validate the API specification and generate a single YAML file. It has an optional argument to indicate the main file path of the API specification.

```bash
pyms merge-swagger --file 'app/swagger/swagger.yaml'
>>  Swagger file generated [swagger-complete.yaml]
